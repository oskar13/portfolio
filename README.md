# portfolio
My personal portfolio site, built with Tailwind CSS, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and automated with GitHub Actions + npm for deployment. Next.js output mode is set to export mode for generating a static site with no need for a node.js runtime when hosting the site.


## Installation

This will generate a static export of the site in the /out directory that can be hosted on any plain HTTP server.



### ðŸš€ Deployment with GitHub Actions
